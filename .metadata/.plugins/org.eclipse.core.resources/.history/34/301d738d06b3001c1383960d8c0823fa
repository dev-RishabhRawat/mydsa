		Check a number is perfect square or not
		 
		The approach, we have followed is:

			First, find out the square root of the given number.
			Calculate the floor value of the calculated square root.
			Find the difference of the floor value with the square root that we have find in step 1.
			At last, compare the value (that we get in step 3) with 0. If the value is equal to 0 the given number is perfect square, else not.
			Let's understand the above stapes through an example.

			Example: Check the number 324 is perfect square or not.

			The square root of 324 is 18.
			The floor value of the square root is 18.
			The difference of square root and floor value is 0.
			The difference is equal to 0. Hence, the given number is perfect square.
